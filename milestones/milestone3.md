## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Our team was able to successfully create and manage our project board, update issue statuses, and complete the required milestone 3. We also created a document outlining our Frontend features for the web app.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
We faced some challenges with coordinating tasks among team members and having availability to work on this Milestone.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
No, we did not finish all of our tasks in the sprint plan for this week due to midterms and other academic commitments. If we had to prioritize the remaining tasks, we would focus on completing the most critical features that are essential for the app's core functionality first, followed by enhancements and additional features.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
At this time, no features or user stories are considered "at risk." If any items do become "at risk," we will reassess our priorities and allocate additional resources or adjust our timeline to ensure completion.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We may need additional guidance on integrating more complex features and troubleshooting any technical issues that arise. Access to examples and best practices for feature implementation and project management would also be helpful.
