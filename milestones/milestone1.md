## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Our group communicated effectively through Slack and divided tasks based on each member's strengths, which helped us make progress. We also managed to clarify our project goals early on, which kept us focused.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One challenge we faced was coordinating schedules among group members to ensure we could both contribute effectively. Additionally, we had some difficulty in clearly defining the scope of features we wanted to implement, which required extra discussions to align our vision for the project.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
As we continue to work on our final project, we may need assistance debugging complex issues that may arise during development. Additionally, support with optimizing the user experience and ensuring accessibility would be beneficial.
