## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
Our group successfully created wireframes for at least three pages in our web app and completed the entity relationship diagram for our database. We were able to clearly define the structure and relationships of our database tables, which will help guide our development process.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One challenge we faced was ensuring that our wireframes accurately represented the user experience and functionality we wanted to implement. Additionally, coordinating among group members to finalize the entity relationship diagram required multiple discussions and revisions.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
We may need some guidance on implementing complex database relationships and integrating them with our front-end components. Support with debugging and optimizing our code as we build out the app could also be helpful. Lastly, feedback on our wireframes and user experience design would be valuable to ensure our app is intuitive and user-friendly.
