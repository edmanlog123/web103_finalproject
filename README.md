## About

### Description and Purpose

Rella is a fitness tracker web app that helps users plan, track, and visualize their workouts on a calendar. It allows athletes to log daily exercises, mark completed sessions, and monitor progress over time. Trainers can create and share personalized workout plans, review athlete performance, and adjust routines as needed.

The goal of Rella is to make staying consistent with fitness simple, structured, and motivating.

### Inspiration

We created Rella because staying consistent with fitness is one of the hardest parts of building healthy habits. Most fitness apps focus on tracking numbers like calories or steps, but few help users plan and visualize their workouts in a way that feels organized and motivating.
We wanted to design a tool that brings structure to daily training — where users can see their routines laid out on a calendar, celebrate progress, and stay accountable. Rella was built to make fitness less about pressure and more about progress — one day, one workout at a time.
